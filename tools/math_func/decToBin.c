/*
Algorythm: Divide the Decimal by 2 until the number being divided is less than 2,
keeping track of any remainders

    12/2 = 6    (0)
    6/2 = 3     (0)
    3/2 = 1     (1) <-- 3/2 = 1 w/ 1 remainder
    1/2 = 1     (1) <-- 1/2 = 1 w/ 1 remainder + 1 is less than 2 so stop looping

 Now, we simply need to write out the remainder in the reverse order — 1100. So, 12 in decimal system is represented as 1100 in binary.
